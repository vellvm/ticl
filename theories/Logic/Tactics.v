(** * Ltac tactics for working with TICL formulas *)
(** For example splitting conjunctions and disjunctions, unfolding inductive and coinductive modalities [AU, AG, EU, EG].
    The [csplit] tactic is used to split conjunctions and disjunctions under a ticl entailment in the goal
    the [cleft] tactic is used to take the left branch of a disjunction under a ticl entailment in the goal,
    the [cright] tactic is used to take the right branch of a disjunction under a ticl entailment in the goal,
    the [cdestruct] tactic is used to destruct conjunctions and disjunctions under a ticl entailment in a hypothesis.
