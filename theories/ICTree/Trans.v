Transition relations over ictrees
==========================================

Trees represent the dynamics of non-deterministic procesess.
In order to capture their behavioral equivalence, we follow the
process-algebra tradition and define bisimulation atop of labelled
transition systems.

A node is said to be _observable_ if it is a visible event, a return
node, or an internal br tagged as visible.
The first transition relation we introduce is [trans]: a tree can
finitely descend through unobservable brs until it reaches an
observable node. At this point, it steps following the simple rules:
- [Ret v] steps to a silently blocked state by emitting a value
label of [v]
- [Vis e k] can step to any [k x] by emitting an event label tagged
with both [e] and [x]
- [BrS k] can step to any [k x] by emitting a tau label

This transition system will define a notion of strong bisimulation
in the process algebra tradition.
It also leads to a weak bisimulation by defining [wtrans] as a
sequence of tau steps, and allowing a challenge to be answered by
[wtrans . trans . wtrans].
Once [trans] is defined over our structure, we can reuse the constructions
used by Pous in [Coinduction All the Way Up] to build these weak relations
-- with the exception that we need to work in Kleene Algebras w.r.t. to model
closed under [equ] rather than [eq].

(*|
The domain of labels of the LTS.
Note that it could be typed more strongly: [val] labels can only
be of type [R]. However typing it statically makes lemmas about
[bind] particularly awkward to state, so this seems to be the
least annoying solution.

(*|
The transition relation over [ictree]s.
It can either:
- recursively crawl through invisible [br] node;
- stop at a successor of a visible [br] node, labelling the transition [tau];
- stop at a successor of a [Vis] node, labelling the transition by the event and branch taken;
- stop at a sink (implemented as a [spin] node that has no successor.
